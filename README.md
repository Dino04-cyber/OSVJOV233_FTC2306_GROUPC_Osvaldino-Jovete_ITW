# Intro To Web

Welcome to my Intro To Web Repository! In this repository, I've been practicing web development skills by creating different versions of my resume using HTML and CSS at CodeSpace Academy. Each HTML file represents a distinct version of my resume, and the CSS file is used for styling these resumes. This README will guide you through the repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains multiple versions of my resume, each implemented as a separate HTML file (resume1.html through resume8.html). The aim is to showcase different styles and layouts while practicing HTML and CSS for web development.

The central CSS file (style.css) is used to maintain consistent styling across all resume versions. It includes rules for fonts, colors, layouts, and other visual elements.

## Folder Structure

Here's an overview of the repository's folder structure:

- `resume1.html` to `resume8.html` - These HTML files represent different versions of my resume.
- `style.css` - The central CSS file for styling all the resume versions.

You can explore each resume version by opening the respective HTML file in your web browser. The CSS file ensures that all versions maintain a consistent design theme.

## Getting Started

To view the different resume versions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-versions.git
